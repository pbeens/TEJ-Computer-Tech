On the slide for each component include the following:

* Name of the component

* Picture of the component

* Short description, in your own words, of what that component does

* The price for a standard and high-end version of the component

For the pricing, there will be a big range. The important part is to go look on some computer websites and consider a few options. Remember to list two separate prices; an average price for the component and the price of a high-end model of the component

## Self-assessment

* I can visually identify the major components of a computer system 
* I can define the major components of a computer system
* I know what a reasonable price is for each computer component
